            <h3>what is Photography?</h3>
            <p>Photography is the result of combining several technical discoveries, relating to seeing an image and capturing the image. The discovery of the camera obscura ("dark chamber" in Latin) that provides an image of a scene dates back to ancient
                China. Greek mathematicians Aristotle and Euclid independently described a camera obscura in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE.[11][12] In the 6th century CE, Byzantine mathematician Anthemius of Tralles used a type of camera obscura in his
                experiments.

                A professional wedding photographer is not just an individual you pay ridiculous sums to just flash a camera in your face and eat free kacchi. He/she is a well-seasoned professional, equipped with the best gear to immortalise your memories of how you
                felt during your wedding versus how it shows in pictures in years to come.

                Wildlife photography is a genre of photography concerned with documenting various forms of wildlife in their natural habitat. As well as requiring photography skills, wildlife photographers may need field craft skills. For example, some animals are difficult
                to approach and thus a knowledge of the animal's behavior is needed in order to be able to predict its actions.
